## 🤖 Machine Learning & Data Science

### Q4: Why did you choose Random Forest for this problem?

**Answer:**
"Random Forest was optimal for several reasons:
1. **Handles mixed data types**: Our dataset has numerical (age, balance) and categorical (geography, gender) features
2. **Robust to overfitting**: Ensemble method reduces variance
3. **Feature importance**: Provides interpretable insights for business users
4. **Handles imbalanced data**: With class_weight='balanced' parameter
5. **No scaling required**: Unlike SVM or neural networks
6. **High accuracy**: Achieved 86.65% with good precision-recall balance"

### Q5: How did you handle the imbalanced dataset?

**Answer:**
"Multiple strategies:
1. **Stratified sampling**: Used stratify=y in train_test_split to maintain class distribution
2. **Class weighting**: Set class_weight='balanced' in Random Forest to penalize majority class
3. **Evaluation metrics**: Used ROC-AUC score instead of just accuracy for better assessment
4. **Cross-validation**: 5-fold CV to ensure robust performance across splits
5. **Business context**: Optimized for precision on churn class to minimize false positives"

### Q6: What features are most important for churn prediction?

**Answer:**
"Top 5 features by importance:
1. **Age** (0.2847): Middle-aged customers (35-55) show highest churn
2. **Balance** (0.2156): Very high or very low balances indicate risk
3. **EstimatedSalary** (0.1398): Income level affects product needs
4. **CreditScore** (0.1204): Financial health indicator
5. **NumOfProducts** (0.0876): Single-product customers 3x more likely to churn

These insights drive our personalized retention strategies."

### Q7: How do you evaluate model performance?

**Answer:**
"Multi-metric evaluation approach:
- **Accuracy**: 86.65% overall correctness
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.89 (excellent discrimination)
- **Precision**: 76% for churn class (low false positives)
- **Recall**: 47% for churn class (acceptable for business cost)
- **F1-Score**: 58% balanced measure
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold CV for robust assessment
- **Business metrics**: Cost-benefit analysis of retention vs acquisition"

### Q8: How do you handle overfitting?

**Answer:**
"Several techniques implemented:
1. **Train-validation-test split**: 70-15-15 split for unbiased evaluation
2. **Cross-validation**: 5-fold CV during hyperparameter tuning
3. **Random Forest parameters**: max_depth=10, min_samples_split=5 to control complexity
4. **Feature selection**: Removed irrelevant features (RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname)
5. **Regularization**: Through ensemble averaging in Random Forest
6. **Early stopping**: Monitored validation performance during grid search"

## ⚛️ Frontend (React) Questions

### Q9: Why did you choose React for the frontend?

**Answer:**
"React was ideal because:
1. **Component-based**: Reusable FormField, ResultCard, and ManagerChatbot components
2. **State management**: useState hooks for form data, results, and chatbot state
3. **Real-time updates**: Efficient re-rendering when predictions come back
4. **Developer experience**: Great debugging tools and rich ecosystem
5. **Modern practices**: Hooks, functional components, and ES6+ features
6. **Responsive design**: Easy to create mobile-friendly interfaces"

### Q10: How does your React application handle state management?

**Answer:**
"State management strategy:
```javascript
// Form state for user inputs
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({...});

// Results state for ML predictions
const [result, setResult] = useState(null);

// UI state for loading, errors, chatbot
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState('');
const [chatbotOpen, setChatbotOpen] = useState(false);
```

Used local component state since data doesn't need to be shared across many components. For larger apps, I'd consider Redux or Context API."

### Q11: How do you handle API calls in React?

**Answer:**
"Axios-based implementation with error handling:
```javascript
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict', apiData);
    setResult(response.data);
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err.response?.data?.error || 'Connection failed');
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

Benefits: automatic JSON parsing, request/response interceptors, timeout handling, and clean error management."

### Q12: How did you make the UI responsive?

**Answer:**
"CSS Grid and Flexbox approach:
1. **CSS Grid**: `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))` for responsive form fields
2. **Media queries**: Breakpoints at 1024px, 768px, and 480px
3. **Flexible layouts**: Flexbox for chatbot, buttons, and card components
4. **Viewport units**: vw, vh for full-screen elements
5. **Progressive enhancement**: Mobile-first design approach

The chatbot resizes from 400px width on desktop to full-screen on mobile."

### Q13: Explain your component architecture.

**Answer:**
"Modular component design:
- **App.js**: Main container with state management
- **FormField**: Reusable input component handling text, select, checkbox types
- **ResultCard**: Displays prediction results with risk indicators
- **ManagerChatbot**: Standalone chat interface with message state

Each component has single responsibility, making code maintainable and testable. Props flow down, events bubble up following React best practices."

model = None

def load_or_train_model():
    global model
    if os.path.exists('churn_model.pkl'):
        model = joblib.load('churn_model.pkl')  # Load once at startup
    else:
        train_new_model()  # Auto-train if missing

# Model loaded once, used for all requests
```

Benefits: No repeated file I/O, faster response times, automatic fallback to training."

### Q17: How do you handle errors in Flask?

**Answer:**
"Comprehensive error handling:
```python
try:
    # Data validation
    if not data:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No data provided'}), 400
    
    # Missing field check
    missing_fields = [field for field in required_fields if field not in data]
    if missing_fields:
        return jsonify({'error': f'Missing: {missing_fields}'}), 400
        
    # Model prediction
    prediction = model.predict(input_df)[0]
    
except ValueError as ve:
    return jsonify({'error': f'Invalid input: {str(ve)}'}), 400
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f'Prediction error: {e}')
    return jsonify({'error': 'Internal server error'}), 500
```

Returns appropriate HTTP status codes with descriptive error messages."

### Q18: How does the retention strategy generation work?

**Answer:**
"Rule-based business logic system:
```python
def get_retention_strategy(prediction_prob, customer_data):
    strategies = []
    
    if prediction_prob > 0.6:  # High risk
        if customer_data['balance'] > 100000:
            strategies.append('Offer premium banking services')
        elif customer_data['num_of_products'] == 1:
            strategies.append('Cross-sell product bundles')
    
    return strategies
```

Combines ML predictions with business rules based on customer segments, balances, and activity levels."

3. **Reliability**: Deterministic responses vs. potential hallucinations
4. **Maintenance**: Easy to update responses vs. retraining models
5. **Resource efficiency**: No GPU requirements or large model files
6. **Business focus**: Accuracy matters more than conversational ability

For production, I'd consider hybrid approach with intent classification + rule-based responses."

### Q21: How do you handle the chatbot state in React?

**Answer:**
"State management for conversational flow:
```javascript
const [messages, setMessages] = useState([
  { type: 'bot', content: 'Welcome message...', timestamp: new Date() }
]);
const [currentMessage, setCurrentMessage] = useState('');
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

const sendMessage = async () => {
  // Add user message to state
  setMessages(prev => [...prev, userMessage]);
  
  // API call
  const response = await axios.post('/chatbot', { question });
  
  // Add bot response
  setMessages(prev => [...prev, botMessage]);
};
```

Maintains conversation history, handles loading states, and provides typing indicators."
